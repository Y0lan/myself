            <aside>It's the only website about myself - yet. But everything you need to know is on this page. I will
                keep this website as simple as possible because less is more. Also, what else would you need?</aside>

        <h2><strong>Myself?</strong></h2>
        <p>I am a 23 years old student, living in Paris. I have been playing with computers since I was nine years old.
            Always at ease behind a keyboard, finding solutions to various computer problem throughout my teens have
            always been entertaining. I became interested in Computer Science when I first installed GNU/Linux.
            My computer was dying, and Windows was killing it. I never went back to Windows after that.
            Here are a few things that you may like about me:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I gave a talk about free software and why privacy <em>matters</em>.</li>
            <li>I think a lot about what technology is doing to the world and even more about what it can do <em>for</em>
                the world.</li>
            <li>I love programming, and I love solving problems.</li>
            <li>Learning new things has always been a passion. Working hard and seeing my clients happy with the outcome
                of my work is the best feeling in the world.</li>
            <li>I can speak, read and write <strong>English</strong> and <strong>French</strong> fluently.</li>
            <li>My travels in Europe, Africa and Oceania have made me open minded.</li>
            <li>I am constantly trying to improve myself.</li>
            <li>I prefer a good book to video games.</li>
            <li>I flee social media toxicity.</li>
        </ul>

        </blockquote>
        <p>My life has not been the simplest, but it is what makes me who I am. Two things have been very constant in my

        <h2><strong>What about my skills?</strong></h2>
        <p>I can program, design, put in perspective and build a project from the ground up, with sufficient information
            and time.<br>Low level and UNIX are strong interests of mine.</p>
    	<p>If you want me to work with the web, no problem. I'm also highly interested in node.js, react and pure
            javascript. 😊</p>
    	<h2>I can code, but not with every language or tech - yet</h2>
        <p> I am very at ease with <em>C</em>, since I have been learning it since I began computer science school.</p>
        <p> I can work with <em>python</em>, <em>javascript</em> and <em>PHP</em>.<br>
        I can build website with pure HTML / CSS / javascript, even add some PHP. Or simply use Wordpress. <br>
        I can build CLI app using C, or write scripts using python or bash.
        I can also administrate a Linux server and secure it. I also have some knowledge of Windows Active Directory,
            but I would rather not work with Windows.</p>

            if their lives depended upon it.”<br>

        </blockquote>
        <p>I'm not perfect, and one of my biggest faults is wanting to know so much that I never focus truly on one topic.
            I have read a lot more books than the few below, as my life and goals are heavily inspired by
            science fiction novels, dystopian stories, scientific articles, magazines...
            but to put everything here would be pointless.</p>

        	<li><a href="https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/039916524X"> A mind for numbers - Barbara Oakley</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h2><strong>Some people that I respect and look up to</strong></h2>
        <p> Edward Snowden, Richard Stallman, Cal Newport, Uncle Bob, Elon Musk. <br>They all stand for what they do
            through tough times and critics, and they are dedicating their life to improve those of others.
            Their work has been helping humanity for the better.</p>
        <h2>How do I improve myself as of right now ?</h2>
        <p> I am reading <a href="https://eloquentjavascript.net">Eloquent javascript</a> to properly learn javascript.</p>
        <p>I am also reading <a href="https://nostarch.com/tlcl2">The Linux command line</a> because there is always more
            to learn about bash and the command line on unix.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Am I a robot ?</h2>
        <p>No, I am human. <em>**beep bop beep**</em></p>
        <p>More seriously, this website was designed to give a brief overview of myself to people that may work with me.
            But apart from all of the above, I am a (very serious) music lover, I love going to the cinema, reading books,
            having some beers, doing sports.
        See, I am very much human (and friendly)!</p>
