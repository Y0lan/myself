        <h2><strong>Myself?</strong></h2>
        <p>I am a 23 years old student, living in Paris. I have been playing with computers since I was nine years old. Always at ease behind a keyboard, finding solutions to various computer problem trough my teens have always been entertaining. But I became interested in Computer Science when I first installed GNU/Linux when I was 18 years old. My computer was dying, and Windows was killing it. I never went back to Windows after that. Here are a few things that you may like about me:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I gave a talk about free software and why privacy <em>matters</em>.</li>
            <li>I think a lot about what technology is doing to the world and even more about what it can do <em>for</em> the world.</li>
            <li>I love programming, and I love solving problems.</li>
            <li>Learning new things, working hard to understand them, and seeing my clients happy with the result of my hard work is the best feeling in the world.</li>
            <li>I can speak, read and write <strong>English</strong> and <strong>French</strong> fluently.</li>
            <li>I traveled a lot, so I can say that I am very open-minded.</li>
            <li>I am constently trying to improve myself.</li>
            <li>I prefer a good book to video games.</li>
            <li>I flee social media toxicity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><strong>What about my skills?</strong></h2>
        <p>I can program, design, put in perpective and build a project from the ground up, with sufficient information and time.<br>Low level and UNIX is a strong interest of mine.</p>
    	<p>If you want me to work with the web, no problem. I'm also highly interested in node.js, react and pure javascript. üòä</p>
    	<h2>I can code, but not with every language or tech - yet</h2>
        <p> I am very at ease with <em>C</em>, since I have been learning it since I began computer science school.</p>
        <p> I can work with <em>python</em>, <em>javascript</em> and <em>PHP</em>.<br>
        I can build website with pure HTML / CSS / javascript, even add some PHP. Or simply use Wordpress. <br>
        I can build CLI app using C, or write scripts using python or bash.
        Administrate a Linux server, secure it. I also have some knowledge of Windows Active Directory, but I rather not work with Windows.</p>
        <h2><strong>My projects</strong></h2>
        <p>Yes, I did a lot of project in school. But in my first year they were not really worth keeping, and end of my second year, I lost all my data. So here  I'll keep track of all my projects as of October 2019</p>

        <p>I'm not perfect, and one of my biggest faults is wanting to know so much, that I never focus truly on one topic. That is why most books that I began in the optic of learning new things were never finished. I have read a lot more books than the few below, as my life and goals are heavily inspired by science fiction novels, dystopian stories, scientific articles, magazines... but to put everything here would be pointless.</p>

        	<li><a href="https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/039916524X"> A mind for numbers - Barbara Oakley</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h2><strong>Some people that I respect and look up to</strong></h2>
        <p> Edward Snowden, Richard Stallman, Cal Newport, Uncle Bob, Elon Musk. <br>They all stand for what they do through tough times and critics, and they are dedicating their life to improve others. Their work has been helping humanity for the better.</p>
        <h2>How do I improve myself as of right now ?</h2>
        <p> I am reading <a href="https://eloquentjavascript.net">Eloquent javascript</a> to properly learn javascript.</p>
        <p>I am also reading <a href="https://nostarch.com/tlcl2">The Linux command line</a> because there is always stuff to learn about bash and the command line on unix.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Am I a robot ?</h2>
        <p>No, I am human. <em>**beep bop beep**</em></p>
        <p>More seriously, this website was designed to give a brief overview of myself to people wanting to get to know me before working with me. But apart from all of the above, I am a (very serious) music lover, I love going to the cinema, reading books, having some beers, doing sports.
        See, I am very much human (and friendly)!</p>
